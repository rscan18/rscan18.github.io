	<p>I grew up in Providence, RI. and I am 29 years old. I live with my wife and dog in Charkestown, MA, and I attended Syracuse University. After college I worked in kitchens for five years until I came to the sudden realization that I would not be happy owning a restaurant as I had previously thought. I enrolled in graduate school and began interning for an energy technology startup out of Salem, MA called smartACR. I am deeply passionate about the defining challenges of our generation, such as: resource scarcity, food insecurity, fossil fuel independence, and income inequality. My goal is to build a career that facilitates progressive change in the areas I believe to be most pressing for society as a whole. My favorite hobbies include: hiking and skiing, and I am a vintage jazz and rock enthusiast.</p>
