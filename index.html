	<p>I grew up in Providence, RI. and I am 29 years old. I live with my wife and dog in Charlestown, MA, and I attended Syracuse University. After college I worked as a chef for five years until I came to the sudden realization that I would end up feeling unfulfilled if i were to continue on the path of owning a restaurant. I enrolled in graduate school and began interning for an energy technology startup out of Salem, MA called smartACR. I am passionate about our generation's defining-challenges, such as: resource scarcity, fossil fuel independence, and income inequality. My goal is to build a career that adresses these issues and facilitates progressive change through entrepreneurship. My favorite hobbies include: hiking and skiing, and I am a vintage jazz and rock enthusiast.</p>
